# Whispering Woods Cemetery 
I own a cemetery and need to keep track of all the graves to ensure that all maintenance is under control.

I am requesting database table scripts to implement this database table.

## Spec
The full spec is included in the repo in the file called spec.sql

## Deliverables 
The following three files are required to implement the requirements for this repo. I included the information for each of them in the spec. 
* 1 table.sql (create database and table)
* 2 sampledata.sql
* 3 reports.sql

## SQL Requirements
* primary key
* properly named columns
* proper data types
* proper application of not null
* constraints
* files that have the ability to run repeatedly. This would require using drop and use statements.
