I own a cemetery called Whisper Woods. Whisper Woods was established in January of 1713.
We are transitioning from paper records to an electronic record keeper. This will make it easier to direct visitors 
to who they would like to visit. It will also be easier for us to keep track of which plots are taken and what kind of grave care people paid for. 


We need to keep track of everyone that is buried in the cemetery. We need to record their first name, last name, and middle name if applicable. 
We need to have their date of birth and date of death. We also want to record the date they purchased the plot and how much they purchased it for.
We will also need to record what section, street name, and spot number they are buried in. 

The cemetery has a grounds upkeep team that maintains the appearance of the graves but not everyone pays for this service. We need to record who 
purchased a perpetual care package so that we can make sure to stay on top of it. 

Each record has a unique identification code. We use the first letter of their last name, the first two letters of their first name, and then the spot number. 

There are three sections in the cemetery, Section A, B and C. It is then made up of road names and on each road we have a spot number. 

Not always are plots pre-purchased, the purchase of a plot will often only be happen the person has passed away.

Questions: 
    Q: Will you be inputting records of those that purchased a burial plot in advance of death date?
    A: Yes, we also record once a plot is purchased so that we can ensure a space remains open for them. 

    Q: Are the spot numbers repetitive?
    A: No, each spot in the cemetary has a unique number. We do not reuse the same number. However, it is split up by section. 
        In section A we have numbers 1 - 20,000
        In section B we have numbers 20,000 - 40,000
        In section C we have numbers 40,000 - 60,000

    Q: Aside from the perpetual care package, is there any other maintenance package that can be purchased? 
    A: No, we like to keep our grounds neat and clean so we do general upkeep. The perpetual care package ensures extra attention and care is given to those graves. 

    Q: Do you offer double-depth burials, meaning, would you have more than one body in a grave?
    A: No, our personal belief is that it is a disrespectful practice. There will never be more than one person in one grave. 


I would like to produuce the following reports:
    1) I need a list that will be useful to the maintenance crew. I would like to see a list of last name, first name, the section, spot number 
    and if they purchased perpetual care or not.

    2) We have 20,000 plots available in each section. It is helpful for us to know how many plots have not been filled. 
    I would like to know how many people are buried in each section of the cemetary.

    3) For those that passed away, how many years it has been since the person passed away

    4) I would like to see the ages of those that passed away
